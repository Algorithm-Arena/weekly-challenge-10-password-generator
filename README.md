# Weekly Challenge #10 - Password Generator

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that takes a set of at least 5 password rules and generate a password that satisfies those rules.** Most password fields let you validate that the password matches the rules but won't let you generate a valid password that matches them. Be creative with the rules, the goal is to make fun of overly complex set of rules that are seen in some applications!
